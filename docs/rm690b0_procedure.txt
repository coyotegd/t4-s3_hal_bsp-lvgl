1. Pin Mapping for LilyGo T4-S3 (Working Configuration)
According to the pin diagram and successful driver implementation:

Function          | ESP32-S3 Pin | Note
------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------
QSPI DATA0 (SDA)  | GPIO 14      |
QSPI DATA1        | GPIO 10      |
QSPI DATA2        | GPIO 16      |
QSPI DATA3        | GPIO 12      |
QSPI SCK          | GPIO 15      |
QSPI CS           | GPIO 11      |
Display Reset     | GPIO 13      | Active Low
AMOLED TE         | GPIO 18      | Tearing Effect Pin
**Power Enable**  | **GPIO 9**   | **CRITICAL: Must be HIGH to power display**

2. Implementation Strategy (The "Solution")
Bus Configuration: 
- The RM690B0 on this board requires a custom QSPI protocol.
- Standard SPI commands (1-bit) are NOT sufficient for all operations.
- The driver uses `spi_device_polling_transmit` with `SPI_TRANS_MODE_QIO` for data.

Custom QSPI Protocol (The "Secret Sauce"):
- Unlike standard SPI displays, this driver wraps commands in a custom QSPI packet.
- Write Command: Opcode 0x02 (1 byte) + Address (24-bit, 0x00 + Command) + Data.
- Write Data:    Opcode 0x32 (1 byte) + Address (24-bit, 0x00 + Command) + Data.
- This was reverse-engineered/discovered to be necessary for the T4-S3 implementation.

3. Driver Component (components/rm690b0/rm690b0.c)
- Handles the low-level QSPI transactions using the custom 0x02/0x32 opcodes.
- Manages the initialization sequence (Sleep Out, Display On).
- Implements `rm690b0_set_window` and `rm690b0_draw_bitmap` for graphics.

4. Power Sequence
1. Initialize GPIO 9 as Output and set HIGH.
2. Wait 100ms for power rails (AVDD/VCL) to stabilize.
3. Toggle Reset (GPIO 13): Low (10ms) -> High (120ms).
4. Send Initialization Commands (SWRESET, SLPOUT, DISPON).

5. Logical vs. Physical Mapping
- Physical Panel: 450x600 pixels.
- Driver IC (RM690B0): Supports up to 480x600.
- The driver handles the offset to ensure pixels are drawn in the visible area (0-449).
- Landscape Mode (90°): 600x450 logical resolution.

6. PMIC (SY6970)
- The board includes an SY6970 PMIC.
- It is critical to disable the Watchdog timer on the PMIC to prevent power cycling.
- OTG (On-The-Go) power is disabled to save power/prevent conflicts.
